IN DEVELOPMENT

Piano Type is a project that aims to transfer your typing skills into piano skills. This application maps every key to a note,
loads any song, and displays which keyboard keys to press in order to play the song.

The songs are stored in the standard MusicXml format. The sample xml songs were downloaded from www.musescore.com.

Any song can be converted into musicXml and imported into this program with a tool like finale. Once imported the user will be

able to see the keys that need to be typed in order to play the song. 

This project is made with Angular 4.
